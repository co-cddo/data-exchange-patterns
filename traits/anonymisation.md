# Anonymisation

Data anonymization is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection. It is the process of removing personally identifiable information from data sets, so that the people whom the data describe can't be identified.

- **Grouping**:: [[access]]
- **Question**:: Does the data in the system need to be anonymised?


## Advantages

- Can be accessed by more people whilst keeping individuals protected.


## Limitations

- Re-identification can happen when anonymous data is correlated with other datasets.
- Some anonymisation techniques require aggregating data (see [[granularity]]) which can affect the usefulness of the data.
