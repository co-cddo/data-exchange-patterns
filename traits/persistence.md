# Persistence

==todo==

- **Grouping**:: [[storage]]
- **Question**:: Does data persist on the system - if so for how long?


## Advantages

- Ephemeral persistence like caching can help speed things up for users as well as lower pressure on the system (see [[service-level-agreement]]).
- Long-term persistance allows for mastering data (transforming, cleaning, normalising), and linking with other datasets.


## Limitations

- Ephemeral persistance like caching will require some careful handling to ensure compliance with [[legal-basis]].
