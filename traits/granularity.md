# Granularity

Data granularity is the level of detail in a data structure.

For example, a dataset may have records per individual or aggregated by age range.

- **Grouping**:: [[access]]
- **Question**:: How detailed is the data the system holds?


## Advantages

- Low granularity can help with [[anonymisation]] and reducing [[sensitivity]].
- High granularity can help with more detailed data analysis.
- High granularity will help in operational scenarios.


## Limitations

- Low granularity will affect the usefulness of the data or, at the very least, the potential uses out of its initial intent.
